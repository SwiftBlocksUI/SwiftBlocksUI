#  Blocks

`Blocks` is what a `View` is in SwiftUI.
The `SlackBlocksModel.Block` is the wire format of a block (a specific JSON payload).

Unlike SwiftUI `View`s, Slack blocks cannot be arbitrarily nested, but rather have a very
specific structure: an array of `Block` elements.
This is why I called the "Builders" as returning the plural `some Blocks` (the result is always 
an array of API blocks).

The `Blocks` builder structures can be mixed more freely than the resulting Slack blocks,
e.g. you can do a simple:

    Text("ðŸ¥‘ Toast")

And it will synthesize the necessary surrounding blocks, such as:

    RichText {
      Paragraph {
        Text("ðŸ¥‘ Toast")
      }
    }

Don't confuse the `Blocks` builders with the actual API elements, they are designed to
be more convenient than the wire protocol.
