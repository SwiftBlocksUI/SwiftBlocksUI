</h2>

Blocks to generate various kinds of pickers.

This can generate all kinds of different pickers depending on the
`Selection`. The selection both affects the picker type and whether the
picker is a multiselect picker.

> It is different to a SwiftUI Picker, which is single-select, while this one
> can also do multi selects, similar to a SwiftUI List.<br>
> This also doesn't support PickerStyles, not much styling in BlockKit anyways.

### Examples

Static Options with `.tag`:

```swift
Picker("Importance", selection: $importance,
       placeholder: "Select importance")
{
    "High üíéüíé‚ú®".tag("high")
    "Medium üíé"  .tag("medium")
    "Low ‚ö™Ô∏è"     .tag("low")
}
```    

Picker on top of [`Identifiable`](https://nshipster.com/identifiable/) objects:

```swift
Picker("Pick Order", orders, selection: $order) { order in
  "\(order.title)"
}
```

### Model Pickers

If the selection is bound to a `UserID`, `ChannelID` or `ConversationID` (or sets thereof),
specific Slack pickers are generated.
